### Practical information to access the data

Access to the dataset requires acceptance of the registration with EBRAINS upon which it is possible to request access to the dataset.

## Overview

*Project name:* The Swedish National Facility for Magnetoencephalography Parkinson's Disease Dataset (NatMEG-PD)

Data collected April 2019 - March 2020

### Brief overview of the tasks in the experiment

The experiment consists of MEG recording during three tasks - resting state, passive movements, and go task.

**Resting-state.** Three minutes of resting-state MEG while the participants sat with their eyes closed. The participants were instructed to close their eyes, sit still, and relax for three minutes. The recordings began after assuring the participant sat still with their eyes closed.

The goal of the resting-state MEG recordings was to examine how features of cortical somatosensory oscillatory activity differ between PD patients and healthy controls across age and gender and the relation of these features to PD motor symptoms. Resting-state recordings were performed for three minutes while participants sat relaxed with their eyes closed. For more information, see [2].

**Go task.**
Participants responded to a visual cue by pressing a button with their right index finger.

The aim of the go task was to examine the beta ERS and ERD in PD patients and healthy. The background, methods, and results are described by [3].

**Passive movement.**
Passive movements were induced to the right index finger.

The aim of the passive movements was to examine the beta ERS and ERD in PD patients and healthy controls (similar to [4]]). The background, methods, and results are described in [3].

### Description of the contents of the dataset

Summary: 134 - Subjects, 1 - Session

Available Tasks: 
* Resting-state
* Go task
* Passive movements

Available Modalities: 
* Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
* Individualised warped template structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

## Methods

### Subjects

NatMEG-PD includes data from 66 PD patients (age 44-77; 28 female) and 68 healthy controls (age 46-78; 30 female). 

Subjects from the patient group were recruited from the Parkinson's Outpatient Clinic, Department of Neurology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Recruitment of healthy controls was conducted via advertising or amongst spouses of PD patients. 

The criteria of inclusion for the PD group were a PD diagnosis according to the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Diagnostic Criteria with Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-3. Inclusion criteria for the control group were the absence of PD diagnosis, absence of any form of movement disorder, and no history of neurological diseases, psychiatric disorders, or epilepsy. 

Exclusion criteria for both groups were a diagnosis of major depression, dementia, history or presence of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, or history of alcoholism or drug addiction, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

The PD patients participated in the study on their usual prescribed dose of medication.

### Apparatus

MEG recordings were done in a two-layer magnetically shielded room (MSR) (Vacuumschmelze GmbH) using Neuromag TRIUX 306-channel whole-head system with 102 magnetometers and 102 pairs of planar gradiometers. The recordings were sampled at 1000 Hz with an online 0.1 Hz high-pass filter and 330 Hz low-pass filter. All MEG recordings were done in the upright position.

Original MRI data consist of 3D T1-weighted magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence structural images (voxel size: 1x1x1 mm) obtained on a GE Discovery 3.0 T MR scanner. 

### Initial setup

A summary of what setup was performed when a subject arrived: Head-position indicator coils (HPI) was attached to subjects' heads to measure head position and head movement inside the MEG scanner. A Polhemus Fastrak motion tracker was used to digitalise HPI and uniformly sampled additional points of subjects' head shapes.

MEG was recorded simultaneously with vertical and horizontal electrooculogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). An accelerometer was attached to the subject's right index finger to measure movement kinematics.

### Task organisation

The order of the MEG tasks was fixed:
1) Resting-state MEG.
2) Go task MEG
3) Passive movement MEG

Clinical test outside the MEG scanner immediately after the MEG session.

MRI was obtained on a separate day.

### Task details

#### Resting-state
During the three minutes of resting-state, MEG recording participants sat with closed eyes. The participants were given the instructions to close their eyes and relax. The measurements started after assuring the participants sat still with their eyes closed. The start and the end of the three-minute resting-state period is marked with a trigger ("start": STI101 = 1, "stop" STI101 = 64)).

#### Go task
The participants were instructed to respond to a visual cue presented on the screen by pressing a button with their right index finger. The visual cue consisted of a fixed white dot at the middle of the screen. At a random time between 2.5-4.5 s after trial onset, the dot would change colour to red. The instructions were to respond as soon as they saw the dot change colour. After the participant pressed the button, there would be a delay of between 2.0-2.5 s before a new trial began. The task was repeated for 150 trials, split into six blocks of 25 trials with a short intermediate break to counter fatigue. The participants were given a few training trials to familiarise themselves with the task before the recording began. The recording began once the experimenter had ensured that the participants understood and performed the task correct. The onset of the visual cue and the onset of the button press is marked in the trigger channels in the MEG data.

#### Passive movements
Proprioceptive stimulation was induced through passive movements of the right index finger by a custom-made MEG-compatible pneumatic movement actuator. The visual stimulus was matched to the go task, except the participants were explicitly instructed to relax, not to move, and focus their gaze at the visual stimuli. The dot changed colour after a random time interval of 2.5-3.5 s, upon which the passive movement would be induced after an additional interval of 0.2-0.5 s. The movement actuator would move the finger for 0.15 s giving a movement duration of about 0.3 s. The onset of the visual cue and movement actuator are marked in the trigger channels in the MEG data. The movement kinematics can be evaluated using the accelerometer data. There would then be a delay of between 2.0-2.5 s after the activation of the movement actuator before a new trial began. The procedure was repeated for 150 trials. The procedure would begin after the experimenter had ensured that the participant had the index finger placed correctly on the movement actuator and that the participant perceived the passive movement.

#### MRI recordings and data

The original MRI obtained for each participant is not part of NatMEG-PD to protect the privacy of the research participants. Here we provide individual warped templates that anonymise the images by altering the brain compartment's specific structural anatomy but preserve the head's gross geometry. The images are suitable for MEG source reconstruction. For information about the procedure to generate the individual warped templates and potential usage in re-analysis of the MEG data, please see [5].

*Missing data:*
* MRI were not acquired for participants 019, 024, 033, 039, 057, 066, 072, 088, 091, 111, and 129 because of cancellation due to COVID-19 lockdown at the MR scanner facility.
* MRI is missing for participant 061 due to corrupted source files.
* Participant 070 did not do MRI.
